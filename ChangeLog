V 0.90.0  Initial program and upload

V 0.90.1  Some minor GUI fixes

V 0.91  Added Auto-Update functionality

V 0.91.1 Fixed lookup without entering a callsign

V 0.92  Added an Auto-Purge function to the Update function. This removes any VE who has lost 
        their ARRL accreditation from the database. Also reworked the Lookup button. If one 
        has registered their callsign, clicking on the button without entering a callsign 
        will automatically lookup one's statistics. Also reworked the Summary report. For
        1x2 or 2x1 callsigns, if there is a multiple match, one can add a '!' to the end
        of their callsign which will restrict the matching process. It's not perfect. Dropped
        the "Import by State" option which was for testing purposes.

V 0.92.1 Added a check for a new VE during an update

V 0.93 Added refresh of main GUI screen, fixed lookup for an exact match, fixed the detailed 
        report, added the ability to generate a report based on a text file input

V 0.93 Feb18   Discovered a shortcoming in the GUI and fixed it

V 0.94 Added sort ability to detailed report page. The county sort is only for the state level of reports.
        Also added a button for the direction of sort.

V 0.95 Found session count data was being stored incorrectly. Fixed the problem. Previous databases
        will need to be rebuilt (i.e. deleted and re-imported)

V 0.96 Fixed read_text.py to ignore invalid callsigns listed in the text file. Fixed detailed_count_display.py
        for a quicker sort of total options. Fixed sorting in asc-db.py

V 0.96.1 Windows problem with creating a desktop shortcut. Fixed ve_utilities.py

V 0.96.2 Removed warning from detailed report. Cleaned up read_session_count(). Fixed summary report.
          Updated version number.

V 0.97 Added support for GLAARG stats to the program

V 0.97.1 Adjusted GLAARG import/update messages

V 0.97.2 Added message in case GLAARG website is not available

V 0.97.3 &  0.97.3.1 Fixed issues due to glaarg being added

V 0.98 added sort function to 'Other Session Counts' menu, renamed same menu item, 
        added text file capture to the same menu --> stored in Reports directory as
        "another_session_count.txt"

V 0.99 Added ability to do limited fetch by designated States for ARRL, example: fetch only CA & OR states
        instead of all 50 states. Added ability to track when an ARRL fetch is interrupted and pick up at
        the point of interruption afterward. Side Note: added new installation scripts for Linux and MacOS
        systems.

V 0.99.1 Fixed the read_text.py to ignore the new import-update-by-state.txt

V 0.99.2 Fixed cron thread activation code. Problem induced by DB change in V 0.97. Side Note: adjusted install_ASC_Linux.sh
        to account for an older installation of ASC.

V 0.99.3 Removed the code for creating a launcher in the Windows Desktop

V 1.0 Added the ability to reset the database in the case of corruption causing the import function to hang. 
        After resetting the database, you will need to run Set Defaults as well as the Imports.

V 1.0.1 Minor fix in database check

V 1.1 Fixed the logic error in db setup

V 1.2 The ARRL made a change in their website which forced me to use a different method to read the website. (read_session_count.py)

V1.2.1 Found and corrected an obscure logic bug in read_session_count.py

V1.2.2 Fixed an error in the ve_utilities.py file, updated GLAARG session read, 
        For Linux, had to rewrite the program to use a virtual Python environment due to a clash with the default system Python install.
