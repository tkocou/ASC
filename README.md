# ASC-Database

A program to keep track of one's session count with one's accrediting VEC. Currently the ARRL and GLAARG VECs are supported. The power of this program lies not in it's simple interface. Rather, the power resides in it's ability to generate reports.

NOTE: The Windows executable has been compiled on Windows 11 and tested on both Windows 10 & 11.

## A new script has been added for those running a M1/M2 MacOS and Linux systems

NOTE: Linux|MacOS; When a new release of ASC-DB is announced, please re-run the **install_ASC_(macOS | Linux).sh**
